# Pong

This game application is a creative, 2-player, Space-themed recreation of the popular Pong game that was initially developed back in 1972. 

One player uses the arrow keys to move their paddle, and the other player uses WASD to move theirs. When playing my game you'll find that there are varying difficulties that the player is able to choose from, as well as a Cheats menu that both players can use to gain boosts. All graphics were custom developed.

The main programming language that was used for this project was Python along with the pygame library.
